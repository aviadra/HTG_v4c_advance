HTG_v4c_advance
===============

Tasker profile for videoreg
Version 1.1a - moved to github.

Version 1.1 -	Bugfix – Receiving a call re-enables video recording, regardless of if it was disabled manually.
		Changed – The “say” statements to represent the HTG version and not the Hotfortech generation.
		Changed – Obfuscated some Hotfortech personal info.
		Changed – exit car mode sends a “stop videoreg” in the hopes of solving a bug where even if “v4c” is disabled, the camera app doesn’t work until you manually enter videoreg and exit it (or simply reboot) to release the camera device.


Version 1.0 - Init release with the hopes that it is found useful.
